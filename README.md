Blades of Steel Scorekeeper
======

This is a scorekeeping app to track our scores in Blades of Steel. We've got over 1000 games recorded (on paper) and it's about time we ran the numbers. 

### Getting started
To run the app, first install Meteor by running this command in terminal:   
`$ curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`

Then cd into whatever dir rou choose (like `~/Sites`) and clone this repo:   
`git clone git@github.com:mswartz/blades.git [dir where you want it]`

Almost there! Now just `cd blades` and type `meteor`.

Now point your browser to `localhost:3000` and check 'er out. 

### Adding Data
The app doesn't come with any data, you've got to add it using the `/Players` and `/newgame` interface.
